## Challenge:

- The following challenge focuses on using server-side APIs to retrieve information from another application through using parameters that are shown in the url. 

The OpenWeather API has several different types of API to pick from that can take use of the user's local server/input to find out not only historical but future forecast for the weather. Through using HTML and CSS to build the basic dashboard, vanilla JS filled in the API fields to provide current and a 5 day forecast showing temp, wind, humidity, and UVIndex conditions when the user searched for a particular city. 

A weather dashboard is useful since it can help someone plan for their everyday life or a trip and be prepared for the weather.

## Technologies:

HTML, CSS, JavaScript, OpenWeather API
